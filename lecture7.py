# Math Operators:
# Adition operator
add = 5+1

# Substraction Operation
sub = 5-1

# Multiplication Operation
prod = 5*2

# Division Operation
div = 5/2

# Assigning Operations:
operationOne = 2
operationTwo = 2
operationThree = 2

# Exponential Operation
operationOne **= 2

# Floor Division Operation

operationTwo //= 0.5

# Modulo Assignment Operation
operationThree %= 1

# Output:

print("ADD =",add,"Sub =",sub,"Prod =",prod,"Div =",div)
print(operationOne,operationTwo,operationThree)
