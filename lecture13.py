# Flow Control and Comparators:

# 1.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the greater than comparator
varCompOne = 3 > 2
print(varCompOne)

# 2.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the greater than comparator
varCompTwo = 2 > 3
print(varCompTwo)

# 3.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the greater than or equal to comparator
varCompThree = 3 >= 3
print(varCompThree)

# 4.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the greater than or equal to comparator
varCompFour = 3 >= 4

# 5.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the less than comparator
varLesCompOne = 2 < 3

# 6.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the less than comparator
varLesCompTwo = 3 < 2

# 7.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the less than or equal to comparator

# 8.create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the less than or equal to comparator
